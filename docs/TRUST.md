# Trust boundary — 0.2

## Three inputs, different authority

A `.lean` **source outline** is a lexical/layout reading aid. Recognizing `simp`
does not reveal a mathematical derivation. None of the nine OpenAI source-mode
demo declarations is relabelled as kernel checked.

A `proofreader.kernel-export/v2` **typed argument** is a constructor DAG plus a
set of typed proof-subterm judgements. Python validates a strict schema, universe
and binder scope, immutable original-root paths, exact child/argument inventories,
and resource budgets. It does not serve as a Lean type checker.

A **checking observation/receipt** records a run. An imported JSON file is not a
signature, an attestation, or proof of its own origin. The browser never claims to
authenticate it. The release's remote observations include request identifiers,
exact request-source hashes, positive markers and negative outcomes.

## What the generated Lean program checks

1. Exact Lean version and universe-parameter inventory.
2. Transitive axiom inventory matching the argument export.
3. Original declaration statement and proof AST identity, after erasing metadata.
   Proof irrelevance/definitional equality is not substituted for this exactness.
4. The original reconstructed proof submitted as a new kernel-checked theorem.
5. Every recorded proof path followed independently in Lean through that original
   proof; its real enclosing binders are used to close the subterm.
6. Each resulting term/type judgement submitted through `addDecl`: theorem
   declarations for proofs and safe definitions for data arguments.
7. Proposition/data and assumption/object classification checked in Lean.

`debug.skipKernelTC` is forced false around the new declarations. A failure after
root replay but before the final marker is an overall failure. The exact final
marker includes the argument hash and judgement count. The verifier also checks
process/API success, errors, failed declarations, returned source and version.

This still assumes a trusted Lean implementation, checking program, runtime,
project metaprograms, imported dependencies and service execution. It does not
cryptographically authenticate compiled dependencies, hardware, or the service.
An adversarial project with arbitrary metaprogram execution is not made logically
or operationally trustworthy merely by passing a command-line flag.

## What is not certified

The English printer is deterministic and regression-tested, not formally proved.
`check-reading` checks regeneration, not a formal interpretation of English.
Beta/zeta display simplification is bounded and capture-avoiding in the tested
implementation; original expression nodes remain authoritative. Unknown symbols,
recursors, large expressions and named lemmas can remain explicitly unexpanded.
Standard mathematical notation still needs its displayed types and instances.

No human comprehension study, full-corpus prose-completeness result, paper-to-Lean
correspondence proof, or correctness claim for OpenAI's manuscripts is implied.
The v2 enumerator covers theorem declarations, not all proof-valued definitions.
The legacy exporter retains a wider declaration inventory but does not provide
v2 intermediate-judgement verification.

## Axioms and admissions

Default permitted axioms: `propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`. These are
visible, not silently described as axiom-free. Additional axioms require explicit
`--permit-axiom` and remain visible. `sorryAx` / `Lean.sorryAx` cannot be permitted
through that option. An empty transitive axiom inventory is reported separately.

## Execution and transport

Offline reading makes no model, telemetry, CDN or service requests. The local
single-user server accepts source text, not arbitrary filesystem paths. It binds
to loopback and checks Host/Origin; it has no Lean build or shell endpoint.

Native compilation requires `--trust-project`; this does not sandbox anything.
Remote operations require `--allow-remote` and send complete code to AXLE. Remote
requests require UTF-8 JSON, fixed official host, bounded responses and no redirect
following. API keys are read from the environment and excluded from artifacts.

Source snapshots and module/source hashes do not authenticate every dependency
binary. Corpus reports are unsigned reproducible ledgers, not self-authenticating
mathematical certificates. Security tests are not an independent security audit.

## Source-bound route added in 0.3

`source-bound-snapshot` is not `typed-export`. Its formula strings use Lean's pretty-printer. Read docs/NARRATIVE.md for the full trust boundary, re-extraction checks and integer-polynomial certificates. No snapshot or imported receipt self-authenticates. Exact source paths and selected judgements ran on 4.34.1 for the retained example; the full pinned project did not.
